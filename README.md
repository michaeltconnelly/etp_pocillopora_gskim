# Eastern Pacific *Pocillopora* genome skimming

This repository contains scripts and RMarkdown documents for the analysis of low-coverage whole genome sequencing (aka genome skimming) data from *Pocillopora* corals in the eastern tropical Pacific region. *Pocillopora* samples were obtained from various sites in Panama and Costa Rica, and also Clipperton Atoll and Taiwan, and were analyzed to determine species lineages, compare population genetics, and identify dominant microbial symbionts.
